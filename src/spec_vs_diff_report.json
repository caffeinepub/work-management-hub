  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements with good coverage of role transformation, user approval flow fixes, and ClientDashboard enhancements. However, some details about theme styling and specific task metric counting logic are not fully evident in the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Ensure all updated components maintain the Boutique theme with bg-[#FDFCFB] background, thin gold shadows, and Midnight Slate text colors",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated for UserManagementTable.tsx and ClientDashboard.tsx, so the full styling implementation cannot be verified. While the theme appears mentioned in project_state.json, the actual bg-[#FDFCFB] background and gold shadow classes are not visible in the truncated component code.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Profile editing functionality with EditRoleModal and edit profile dialog in ClientDashboard",
      "reason": "The diff shows profile editing features (EditRoleModal, isEditProfileOpen state, editProfileForm, useUpdateProfile mutation) that were not requested in the BuildRequest. The requirement was only to display user information and task metrics, not to enable editing.",

    {
      "description": "Task creation functionality with create task dialog and form in ClientDashboard",
      "reason": "The diff shows task creation features (isCreateDialogOpen, newTask state, handleCreateTask, createTaskMutation) that were not requested. REQ-5 only required displaying task metrics by counting existing tasks, not creating new tasks.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/ClientDashboard.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "WhatsApp integration features with SiWhatsapp icon import",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest mentions displaying WhatsApp phone numbers in the table, but the diff shows additional WhatsApp integration features (icon imports, likely clickable WhatsApp links) that go beyond simple display of phoneNumber field.",
