  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all 8 requirements for the Service Activation Modal. The modal is self-contained using React state and Tailwind CSS, includes all required form fields with exact mock data values, implements reactive calculations with proper formatting, provides comprehensive form validation, and maintains a clean, professional design. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the visible code.",
