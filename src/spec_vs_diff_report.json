The backend/main.mo file contains updateTaskStatus, completeTask, and getClientTasks functions with proper status masking, financial calculations using the specified hourly rates (Junior: 35k, Senior: 55k, Expert: 75k), and TaskClientView type excluding internalData. Frontend integration is present with corresponding hooks and UI components. The migration.mo file properly handles data structure updates for jamEfektif and levelPartner fields.",
